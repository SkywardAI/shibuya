# Shibuya
A project built Electron + React.js, to dig out the potential of WebGPU Inference.

## Development Build
__This project is managed by [pnpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm), but you can still use the package manager you want.__

Run following commands to build the project
```shell
pnpm install
pnpm start dev
```
Or after insall, open 2 terminals and run `pnpm start` and `pnpm electron` on each one.  
This strategy is more convenient for debug.
